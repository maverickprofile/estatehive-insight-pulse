## 🔍 Verify Integration

### Check Approvals Created
```sql
SELECT 
    ar.id,
    ar.action_type,
    ar.status,
    ar.proposed_changes,
    ad.decision_type,
    ad.confidence_score,
    cc.transcription
FROM approval_requests ar
JOIN ai_decisions ad ON ar.decision_id = ad.id
JOIN client_communications cc ON ad.communication_id = cc.id
WHERE ar.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY ar.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Telegram Notifications
```sql
-- See decisions with their approval status
SELECT 
    ad.decision_type,
    ad.status as decision_status,
    ar.status as approval_status,
    cc.channel_id as telegram_chat_id,
    cc.transcription
FROM ai_decisions ad
LEFT JOIN approval_requests ar ON ar.decision_id = ad.id
LEFT JOIN client_communications cc ON ad.communication_id = cc.id
WHERE ad.suggested_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### 1. Create Lead (Needs Approval)
```
"Create a new lead for Alice Brown, phone 555-9999, 
interested in condos, budget 500k to 750k"
```
Expected: Approval request with buttons in Telegram

### 2. Add Note (Auto-Approved)
```
"Add a note that the client prefers oceanview properties"
```
Expected: Auto-approved if confidence > 90%

### 3. Schedule Appointment
```
"Schedule a property viewing tomorrow at 3 PM for Sarah Johnson"
```
Expected: Approval request for scheduling

### 4. Multiple Actions
```
"Create lead for Bob Smith, phone 555-1111, and 
schedule a viewing for next Monday at 2 PM"
```
Expected: Two approval requests, each with buttons

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Buttons Don't Work in Telegram
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure only ONE browser tab is open
3. Restart Telegram bot:
   - Close all browser tabs
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Open fresh tab

### If No Approval Request Created
1. Check AI decision was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM ai_decisions 
   WHERE suggested_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';
   ```

2. Check for errors in voice processing:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM voice_processing_jobs 
   WHERE status = 'failed' 
   AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';
   ```

### If Telegram Shows "Invalid approval request"
The approval might have expired or been processed already. Check:
```sql
SELECT id, status, expires_at 
FROM approval_requests 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```
