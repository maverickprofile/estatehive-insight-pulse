# Estate Hive Voice CRM - Complete Setup Guide 🎤

## ✅ Current Status: OPERATIONAL

Your Voice CRM is working! The system is:
1. Receiving voice messages from Telegram
2. Transcribing with OpenAI Whisper
3. Processing with GPT-3.5-turbo
4. **Sending summaries back to the sender** ✅

## 📱 How It Works

### When someone sends a voice note to your Telegram bot:

1. **Bot receives the voice message** 
   - Queues it for processing
   - Sends: "🎤 Voice message received! Processing..."

2. **System processes the voice**
   - Downloads audio file
   - Transcribes using Whisper API ($0.006/minute)
   - Analyzes with AI for insights

3. **Bot sends back the summary** 
   ```
